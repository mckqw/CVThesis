# Computer Vision Thesis

Written for a Senior Seminar Course. The prompt was as follows:

> This assignment involves research and writing for the Senior Seminar Course.  It is designed to provide an opportunity for reviewing current research in an area of either Computer Science or Information Systems, and to enhance technical writing and presentation skills.
> The course goals are to:
> - Learn about current research in some area of Computer Science or Information Systems
> - Learn to use reference material in the library
> - Learn to write a proposal and synopsis
> - Learn to write a clear technical paper
> - Learn to organize a technical presentation
> - Learn to present technical material orally 

I decided to learn and write on an introduction to Computer Vision. Upon embarking on this project I had to teach myself a number of important Mathmatical concepts such as Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. One helpful website was [Learn OpenCV](https://www.learnopencv.com/histogram-of-oriented-gradients/) and their article on Histograms of Oriented Gradients. All of the resources I have used are found in this repo.

Below is the abstract:
> In recent years, due to significant improvements of sensors, processors, and image processing techniques, major milestones have been made in the field of autonomous vehicles. As a result, the automotive industry and consumers have developed a deep interest in the substantial socioeconomic impact autonomous vehicles have. To realize full autonomous driving, the vehicle must have reliable object detection systems. Lidar, cameras, and other proximity sensors are used to make this possible. Much of the current research and development is being poured into improving various object recognition techniques. A proper background and understanding of Computer Vision is vital to ensure advancement in applications like autonomous vehicles. To provide an effective tool to begin to understand the state of the field in its current form, this paper is devoted to the survey and analysis of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients technique.

This project *is* ongoing. Currently the paper inlcudes three of the six total sections in the finalized version. In that version the sections will be labeled as follows:
 - Introduction
 - Image Processing
 - HOG Feature Descritors
 - Autonomous Vehicles
 - Presentation of Analysis and Findings (Is it applicable to Autonomous Vehicles)
 
There is a [companion paper](https://github.com/mckqw/EthicsOfAV) that reviews the ethics of autonomous vehicles.

This paper was written in [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) with the use of [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
